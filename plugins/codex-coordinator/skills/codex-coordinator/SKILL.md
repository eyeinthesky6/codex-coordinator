# Codex Coordinator

Codex Coordinator is a task-boundary and visibility layer around native Codex tasks. Native Codex remains responsible for tasks, execution, messages, status, and transcripts. This skill records only the minimum metadata needed to avoid planned overlap. It does not create background management.

Supported project marker schema: `2`. A schema-1 enabled project is legacy state and must be migrated before coordinated writes. A disabled marker remains an opt-out and is not read further.

## Load only what the action needs

- Starting, joining, splitting, claiming, completing, or integrating work: read [references/operations.md](references/operations.md), then [references/execution.md](references/execution.md).
- Sending or acting on a peer collision or dependency notice: also read [references/messaging.md](references/messaging.md).
- Enabling, disabling, installing, or onboarding: read [references/installation.md](references/installation.md).
- Recovering a stale or interrupted claim: read [references/recovery.md](references/recovery.md).
- Updating, removing, or changing Coordinator itself: read [references/maintenance.md](references/maintenance.md).
- Checking whether the installed package can load: read [references/doctor.md](references/doctor.md).

Read each selected file completely. Do not load every lane for ordinary work.

## Enablement

1. Resolve the Git common repository and primary worktree.
2. Read `.codex/coordination/project.yaml` before any other Coordinator state.
3. `coordination_enabled: false` is an explicit opt-out. Continue normally and read no board records.
4. `coordination_enabled: true` with schema 2 enables the board. It does not automatically create, pin, wake, or retain a Coordinator task. The user may explicitly designate one normal task as the Coordinator for one goal.
5. When the marker is absent, initialise only after a direct request to enable Coordinator, an explicit `$codex-coordinator` request for real parallel work, or the repository guidance's verified active-task trigger. Otherwise create nothing.
6. A global installation alone manages no repository.

## Core invariants

- Default to one native Codex task. Create durable task windows only when the user explicitly asks for decomposition or a Coordinator and the work has two or three substantial, complete verticals that can progress with little coordination chatter.
- Three active durable tasks is the normal maximum. Going above three requires a direct user decision recorded by the claiming task. Twelve is the hard board limit.
- An explicitly requested Coordinator is one normal, goal-scoped task. It gives each durable task a complete goal and visible work boundary, remains available when the user invokes it again, and ends when the goal ends. It is not automatically created and does not become permanent repository management.
- The Coordinator claims the exclusive `goal-coordination` action. Its bounded claim goal is the shared goal shown in the generated `CURRENT.md`. It need not claim source paths unless it will edit them.
- The Coordinator may assign two or three substantial verticals. A vertical includes the investigation, implementation, focused tests, and documentation needed for its bounded outcome; do not split routine commands, small reviews, or mechanical edits into separate windows.
- Reuse before create. Before opening a durable task, the Coordinator checks for a suitable related local task in the same repository and primary checkout. Reuse it with one bounded `GOAL_ASSIGNMENT` when it is not busy with unrelated work or waiting on a user decision. Create a new local task only when no suitable task exists.
- Every coordinated task uses the same primary checkout, current worktree, and current branch. No coordinated task creates or switches a branch or worktree. If the host cannot place a new task in that shared checkout, do not create that task window.
- Native task creation is asynchronous, and completion does not automatically wake the Coordinator. Do not promise automatic fan-in or unattended completion. The Coordinator reads current state and combines finished results only when it is invoked again. Parent-owned subagents remain suitable for short dependent checks that must return inside one live task.
- Each active writer owns exactly one JSON claim named by its exact native thread UUID under `.codex/coordination/active/`. Claims contain only title, bounded goal, paths, exclusive actions, dependencies, status, timestamps, and revision.
- Never store prompts, transcript text, reasoning, commentary, tool calls, tool output, code, provider responses, or whole-turn ledgers in Coordinator state.
- Resolve the primary worktree before using the board. Linked worktrees do not keep a separate authoritative board.
- Before substantial writes or an exclusive action, list the active board and atomically create or update the current task's own claim with the bundled [state helper](scripts/coordination_state.py).
- Update a claim only at natural lifecycle boundaries: start, real scope change, blocked or unblocked state, and completion or stop. Never update it on a timer or as a progress diary.
- Generated schema-2 `CURRENT.md` is the active-only human view backed by the per-task claims. It is non-authoritative and is atomically rebuilt from those claims after state mutations. Warning and conflict checks use the claims.
- A task edits only its own claim. It never edits another task's claim, receipt, or history.
- Repository-relative path overlap is an advisory warning, including equal and ancestor paths. It does not block a task. Re-read a shared file before applying a narrow change; pause only when the same file hunk or generated command is actually colliding.
- Exclusive actions conflict on exact action name and remain the only board-level claim lock. Keep them narrow and use them only for truly singular operations such as one goal Coordinator, one release publication, one deployment, or one database migration. Legacy `git-integration` claims are advisory and must not be used for new work.
- The board is advisory ownership metadata, not a filesystem lock or sandbox. Git and the Codex execution environment remain the enforcement surfaces.
- Use cooperative Git in the shared checkout. Establish the shared branch before parallel writers start. Any task may commit its reviewed files by staging explicit paths only and protecting foreign staged changes. Never use broad staging, destructive Git cleanup, branch switching, rebasing, or force-pushing while other writers are active. Pull requests are optional repository policy, not a Coordinator requirement.
- Shared generated maps, lockfiles, schemas, indexes, and full gates have no durable task owner. Read-only checks may always run. Serialize only the actual command that writes a shared output, then inspect and commit its exact files.
- Cross-task traffic is sparse. Peer `COLLISION`, `DEPENDENCY`, and `RELEASED` notices are non-executable. One `GOAL_ASSIGNMENT` may carry bounded in-repository work only from the exact active `goal-coordination` owner under the user's current shared goal; it cannot grant destructive or external authority and creates no acknowledgement chain.
- A direct user stop applies immediately. Release the claim when the task is at a safe boundary; never wait for another task's approval.
- Time, silence, `idle`, `notLoaded`, or a missing filtered search result never proves a claim stale. Use exact native terminal, archived, or unusable evidence before releasing another task's stale claim.
- Full filesystem access is capability, not user authority. Before an intentional write outside the current Git common repository, tell the user the exact target and why. If the request did not already authorise it, wait for approval.
- Provider, release, deployment, database, environment, and scheduled-task actions stay with the task that owns that work. The board does not monitor them automatically or grant permission.
- Optional observers are not part of the core path. If one is added as a separate product, it must be manually started, read-only, and have no task authority.
- Doctor is a manual read-only compatibility check. A broken or outdated installation is fixed through normal plugin update or reinstall, never in-place self-repair.
- SessionStart reads only the bounded marker and emits a short hint. It never starts a process, installs Python, scans the board, reads archives, inspects private Codex databases, or launches optional tools.
- Stop checks only the current native task's exact claim. If an active claim remains, it requests one bounded housekeeping continuation so that task releases finished work or explicitly retains unfinished ownership. It ignores transcripts and other claims, writes nothing, and uses Codex's stop-hook circuit breaker so it cannot loop.

## Minimal operating loop

1. Check the marker. If disabled, stop Coordinator work.
2. Resolve the primary worktree and list active claims.
3. Keep the current user request in one task unless the user explicitly requests coordination and two or three complete durable verticals are justified.
4. Claim the planned paths for visibility and only the exact exclusive actions needed before substantial writes.
5. Work inside the claim. Update it only when the boundary, status, or dependency changes.
6. Treat path overlap as a warning. Continue compatible work and pause only the exact hunk or write command that is actually colliding; send at most one notice when immediate coordination is useful.
7. When explicitly acting as Coordinator, claim `goal-coordination`, reuse suitable related local tasks before creating any new local task, assign complete verticals in the shared checkout, then yield. Do not poll, request periodic progress, or wait for automatic wake-up. Read the current active state when the user invokes the Coordinator again.
8. Before the final answer for completed, stopped, or replaced work, move the task's active claim to one compact cold receipt. A goal-scoped Coordinator may retain its own bounded claim only while the user still expects on-demand integration for that goal. If the Stop guard catches an unresolved active claim, resolve only that claim; never turn the check into cross-task reconciliation.
9. Report product results through native tasks. Do not duplicate their transcripts in project state or maintain a second task ledger.

## Failure posture

Fail closed only on an unsupported enabled marker, project mismatch, invalid native identity, malformed board record, an exact exclusive-action conflict, lost revision, unclear external authority, or a safety-critical actual write collision. A path warning alone is not a blocker. Preserve authorised work and report the exact blocker. Do not add background monitoring or broad protective machinery to compensate.
