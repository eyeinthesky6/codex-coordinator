# Compatibility check

Doctor is a manual, read-only compatibility check. It is not a repair agent, project scanner, scheduler, model review, findings writer, or second task authority.

Run the installed script from its package:

```text
python scripts/codex_coordinator_doctor.py --check
```

It verifies only the packaged manifest, schema-22 capability contract, skill frontmatter and links, state-helper syntax, project-lifecycle syntax, hook registration, and hook syntax. It does not run the hook, inspect projects, read Codex databases or transcripts, scan rollouts, write diagrams, compare private paths, or modify installed files.

Results are `healthy` or `broken`. On `broken`, report:

> Codex Coordinator is broken or outdated. Update or reinstall the plugin from its configured marketplace or source.

Do not copy files, repair targets, roll back an installation, create a task, start Mission Control, or schedule a follow-up. The plugin manager owns update and reinstall.

Legacy `--apply` requests are rejected without writing and return the same update-or-reinstall action.
